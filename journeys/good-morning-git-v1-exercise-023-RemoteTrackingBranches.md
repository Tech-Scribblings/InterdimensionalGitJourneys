# Exercise 023 - Remote Tracking Branches

In this exercise, you'll learn how to work with remote tracking branches, which allow
you to track the progress of other developers' work in remote repositories. It's like
tuning into the signals from distant universes!

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Add a remote repository using `git remote add <remote_name> <repository_url>`.

3. Fetch the remote repository's branches using `git fetch <remote_name>`.

```
   Time-Space Diagram:
   -------------------
   local       A---B---C
                     \
   remote             D---E---F
   -------------------
```

4. Run `git branch -r` to list all remote tracking branches.

5. Check out a remote tracking branch with `git checkout --track <remote_name>/<branch>`.

6. Make some changes to your files and commit them.

7. Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push`.

Congratulations! You have successfully worked with remote tracking branches. With this
skill, you can collaborate with fellow time-travelers across different universes!

Nerdy Joke: Why do developers love remote tracking branches? They can keep an eye on
their colleagues' progress in the multiverse of code!
