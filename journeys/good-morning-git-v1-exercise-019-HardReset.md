# Exercise 019 - Hard Reset

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git reset with the `--hard` option to undo
commits and discard all changes since the specified commit.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Make a few changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

3. Run `git log` to view the commit history.

4. Choose a previous commit hash you want to reset to.

5. Run `git reset --hard <commit_hash>` to reset your branch to the specified commit,
   discarding all changes since that commit.

6. Run `git status` to confirm that your changes have been discarded.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git reset with the `--hard` option to undo
commits and discard all changes since the specified commit. With this skill, you can
erase unwanted changes from your codebase's timeline.

Nerdy Joke: Why do developers love hard reset? It's the ultimate "undo" button when
time-traveling in code!
