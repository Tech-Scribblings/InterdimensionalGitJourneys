# Exercise 033 - Temporal Stash

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git stash to temporarily save your
changes while you navigate the fabric of time and space. As a time-traveling
developer, you'll discover the power of the Temporal Stash, a secret tool that
allows you to safely store your work in the folds of the multiverse!

Your team is hard at work, fighting against interdimensional bugs that threaten
the very nature of reality. But as you're about to squash one particularly
troublesome bug, you receive a distress call from a parallel universe. You need
to temporarily abandon your work and jump to the rescue, but how can you ensure
your changes are safe and sound?

Fear not! The Temporal Stash is here to save the day.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Check your current changes with `git status` and `git diff`.

3. Use `git stash save "A brief message describing your changes"` to
   temporarily store your changes in the Temporal Stash.

```
   Time-Space Diagram:
   -------------------
   main       A---B---C---D---E
                       \
   stash                S (Stashed changes)
   -------------------
```

4. With your changes safely stashed away, switch to the branch where you need to
   address the distress call using `git checkout <branch>`.

5. After resolving the issue and saving the parallel universe, return to your
   original branch with `git checkout <original-branch>`.

6. Retrieve your stashed changes using `git stash apply` or `git stash pop` (if
   you want to remove the stash after applying it).

7. Continue working on your original task, confident that your changes are
   safely restored and the multiverse is once again in balance.

Congratulations! You've mastered the art of the Temporal Stash, allowing you to
navigate the complex web of parallel universes without losing track of your work.

Nerdy Joke: Why do time-traveling developers use git stash? Because they always
want to keep their code in a safe space-time!

Here's a bonus ASCII diagram to illustrate your team's amazing adventures:

      ____
    /      \
   /  --o-\_/____
  <_ \_____||__></
     ||       |||

Remember, with great time-traveling power comes great responsibility. Use your git
skills wisely, and work together with your fellow developers to maintain the
integrity of the space-time continuum, one stash at a time!
