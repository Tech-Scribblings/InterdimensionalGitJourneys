# Exercise 002 - Time Travel with Checkout

In this exercise, you'll learn how to travel back in time to a previous commit using the
git checkout command.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Run `git log --oneline` to view a concise log of your commits.

3. Take note of the commit hash of the commit you want to travel back to.

4. Run `git checkout <commit-hash>` to travel back in time to the specified commit.

   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash you noted in step 3.

Congratulations! You have successfully time-traveled to a previous commit. Be careful not
to alter the past too much, or you might create a time paradox!

Nerdy Joke: Why don't time travelers use Git to undo their mistakes? They already have a
"reset hard" button!
