# Exercise 002 - Time Travel with Checkout

Before you depart, you recall a humorous quipyou once heard: 'Why don't 
time travelers use Git to undo their mistakes?They already have a reset 
hard button!' With a chuckle, you prepare todelve into the past.

As you stand at the TARDIS console, you set thecoordinates to a specific 
commit in your repository's past. The familiarwhirring sound of the time 
machine fills your ears, and you brace for thejourney back in time.

Having mastered the art of navigating paralleluniverses, you now face a 
new challenge: time travel within a singletimeline. Git's checkout command 
is your trusty tool in this endeavor.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to travel back in time to a previous commit using the
git checkout command.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Run `git log --oneline` to view a concise log of your commits.

3. Take note of the commit hash of the commit you want to travel back to.

4. Run `git checkout <commit-hash>` to travel back in time to the specified commit.

   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash you noted in step 3.

Congratulations! You have successfully time-traveled to a previous commit. Be careful not
to alter the past too much, or you might create a time paradox!

Nerdy Joke: Why don't time travelers use Git to undo their mistakes? They already have a
"reset hard" button!
