# Exercise 012 - Using Tags

In this exercise, our hero will learn to create and use tags, harnessing 
their power to navigate through the most critical moments in codebase 
history. With this newfound knowledge, our hero will be better equipped to 
travel the multiverse and shape
the future of countless timelines.

Tags allow our intrepid developer to mark significant moments in time, 
creating a roadmap through the ever-shifting landscape of the codebase. 
These tags can be lightweight or annotated, depending on the needs of the 
time-space traveler.

In the vast expanse of the codebase multiverse, git tags serve as beacons 
of light, guiding time-traveling developers on their journey through the 
tangled web of time and space. Our hero, armed with the knowledge of 
branches, now ventures forth to master the art of tagging.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create and use tags to mark important points in
your project's history.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Create a new branch called "tag-test" and switch to it:
   Run `git checkout -b tag-test`.

3. Make some changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

4. Create a lightweight tag by running `git tag v1.0`.

5. Create an annotated tag by running `git tag -a v1.1 -m "Annotated tag message"`.

6. Run `git tag` to list all tags in your repository.

7. Use `git show <tag>` to view the details of a specific tag.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and used tags to mark important points
in your project's history. Tags can help you travel to specific moments in time, just
like time machines!

Nerdy Joke: Why do time travelers use git tags? They need bookmarks for their favorite
moments in code history!
