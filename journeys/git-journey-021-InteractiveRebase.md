# Exercise 021 - Interactive Rebase

Embrace your destiny and follow the steps in
this exercise to learn interactive rebase. With this skill, you will truly
become a master of time and code. Good luck, and remember - the future is
in your hands!

As an aspiring time-traveling developer, you've
been chosen to learn the secrets of interactive rebase. Your mission is to
master this technique and reshape the timeline of your codebase with ease,
while avoiding the dreaded butterfly effect.

In the far reaches of the Git Cosmos, where
time-traveling developers manipulate the very fabric of reality, there
exists a powerful technique known as interactive rebase. This mystical
skill allows them to rewrite history without worrying about the butterfly
effect.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git rebase interactively to rewrite your
commit history. It's like editing the script of your time-travel adventure!

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Create a new branch and switch to it using `git checkout -b new_branch`.

3. Make a few changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

4. Run `git log` to view the commit history.

5. Choose a previous commit hash you want to rebase from.

6. Run `git rebase -i <commit_hash>` to start the interactive rebase process. Your
   default text editor will open with a list of commits and commands.

7. Edit the list to change the order, squash commits, or change commit messages.

8. Save and close the file to complete the interactive rebase process.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git rebase interactively to rewrite your
commit history. You can now edit the timeline of your codebase with ease!
