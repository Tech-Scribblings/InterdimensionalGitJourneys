# Exercise 017 - Soft Reset

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git reset with the `--soft` option to undo
commits, while keeping the changes staged.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Make a few changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

3. Run `git log` to view the commit history.

4. Choose a previous commit hash you want to reset to.

5. Run `git reset --soft <commit_hash>` to reset your branch to the specified commit,
   keeping your changes staged.

6. Run `git status` to confirm that your changes are still staged.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git reset with the `--soft` option to undo
commits, while keeping the changes staged. With this skill, you can carefully
manipulate the space-time fabric of your codebase.

Nerdy Joke: Why do developers love soft reset? It's like having a time machine that
keeps your luggage packed!
