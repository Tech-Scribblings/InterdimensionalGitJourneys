# Exercise 015 - Remote Repositories

In this exercise, our hero will learn how to work with remote 
repositories, allowing them to collaborate with other time-space travelers 
and share their code throughout the multiverse. With this knowledge, our 
hero will be better prepared to face the challenges that await them in the 
vast expanse of the codebase multiverse.

Remote repositories are the portals that connect dimensions, enabling 
time-traveling developers to collaborate and share their code across space 
and time. Mastering the use of these portals is crucial to maintaining 
order in the multiverse.

In the codebase multiverse, collaboration with fellow time-space travelers 
is essential to ensure the stability of countless realities. Our hero, now 
skilled in the arts of branching, tagging, and stashing, must learn to 
work with remote repositories to share their adventures across the 
multiverse.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to work with remote repositories, allowing you to
collaborate with other time-space travelers.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Run `git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>` to add a remote repository
   named "origin".

3. Run `git push -u origin main` to push your "main" branch to the remote repository.

4. Run `git fetch origin` to fetch changes from the remote repository without merging
   them into your local branches.

5. Run `git pull origin main` to fetch changes from the remote repository and merge
   them into your local "main" branch.

Congratulations! You have successfully worked with remote repositories, allowing you to
collaborate with other time-space travelers. Now you can share your adventures across
the multiverse!

Nerdy Joke: What do time-traveling developers use to share their code across
dimensions? Remote repositories, of course!
