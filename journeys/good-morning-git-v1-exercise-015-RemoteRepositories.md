# Exercise 015 - Remote Repositories

In this exercise, you'll learn how to work with remote repositories, allowing you to
collaborate with other time-space travelers.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Run `git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>` to add a remote repository
   named "origin".

3. Run `git push -u origin main` to push your "main" branch to the remote repository.

4. Run `git fetch origin` to fetch changes from the remote repository without merging
   them into your local branches.

5. Run `git pull origin main` to fetch changes from the remote repository and merge
   them into your local "main" branch.

Congratulations! You have successfully worked with remote repositories, allowing you to
collaborate with other time-space travelers. Now you can share your adventures across
the multiverse!

Nerdy Joke: What do time-traveling developers use to share their code across
dimensions? Remote repositories, of course!
