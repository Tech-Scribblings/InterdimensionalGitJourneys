# Exercise 012 - Using Tags

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create and use tags to mark important points in
your project's history.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Create a new branch called "tag-test" and switch to it:
   Run `git checkout -b tag-test`.

3. Make some changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

4. Create a lightweight tag by running `git tag v1.0`.

5. Create an annotated tag by running `git tag -a v1.1 -m "Annotated tag message"`.

6. Run `git tag` to list all tags in your repository.

7. Use `git show <tag>` to view the details of a specific tag.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and used tags to mark important points
in your project's history. Tags can help you travel to specific moments in time, just
like time machines!

Nerdy Joke: Why do time travelers use git tags? They need bookmarks for their favorite
moments in code history!
