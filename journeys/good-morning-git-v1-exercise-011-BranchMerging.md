# Exercise 011 - Branch Merging

In this exercise, you'll learn how to merge one branch into another, combining their
histories and changes.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Create a new branch called "feature-branch" and switch to it:
   Run `git checkout -b feature-branch`.

3. Make some changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

4. Switch back to the "main" branch by running `git checkout main`.

5. Merge the "feature-branch" into the "main" branch by running `git merge feature-branch`.

6. If there are no conflicts, the merge will be successful, and your changes from the
   "feature-branch" will be incorporated into the "main" branch.

Congratulations! You have successfully merged a branch into another, combining their
histories and changes. This is a crucial skill for navigating parallel universes in
your codebase.

Nerdy Joke: Why do developers use branches? They want to explore every possible
timeline in their code!
