# Exercise 000 - Initialize Your Time Machine

Familiarizing yourself with the controls, younotice a joke written on a 
nearby chalkboard: 'Why did the time travelerrefuse to use Git? He was 
afraid of committing to the past!' Chuckling toyourself, you set your 
sights on adventure and prepare for lift-off.

You find yourself standing in front of a giantblue box, the words 'Time 
and Relative Dimension in Space' etched into itsside. As you step inside, 
you prepare to initialize your very own Gitrepository and begin your 
time-traveling escapades.

Welcome, time-traveling apprentice! Today, youembark on a grand adventure 
through the spacetime continuum. Your trustytool for this journey is none 
other than Git, the ultimate time machine.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to initialize your very own time machine (a.k.a. git
repository) and take your first steps into the spacetime continuum.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you want to create your new git
   repository.

2. Run `git init` to initialize an empty git repository.

   This command creates a hidden directory named `.git` that contains all the necessary
   files to manage your time machine.

3. Create a file named `README.md` and add some initial content. This file will serve as
   a logbook for your time-traveling adventures.

4. Run `git add README.md` to stage the file for your first commit.

5. Run `git commit -m "Initialize time machine"` to create your initial commit.

Congratulations! You have successfully initialized your time machine and made your first
commit. Now you're ready to explore the vast expanse of time and space!

Nerdy Joke: Why did the time traveler refuse to use Git? He was afraid of committing to
the past!
