# Exercise 026 - Submodules

Embark on an interdimensional journey and learn to create wormholes with 
git submodules. Bridge the gap between parallel universes and unlock the 
potential for infinite collaboration!

In the realm of Git, submodules play a similar role. They serve as stable 
wormholes, connecting external repositories to your project, allowing for 
seamless collaboration across the multiverse of code.

In a universe filled with countless parallel worlds, scientists strive to 
connect these dimensions and harness the power of interdimensional 
collaboration. By creating stable wormholes, they bridge the gaps between 
these worlds, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and wisdom.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git submodules to include external
repositories in your project. It's like creating a stable wormhole between
parallel universes!

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Add a submodule using `git submodule add <repository_url> <path>`.

```
   Time-Space Diagram:
   -------------------
   main       A---B---C---D---E
                       \
   submodule            F---G---H
   -------------------
```

3. Commit the changes to your main repository.

4. Clone the main repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules <repository_url>`.

5. Update the submodule to the latest commit using `git submodule update --remote`.

6. Commit and push the changes to your main repository.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git submodules to include external
repositories in your project. You've created a bridge between parallel universes,
expanding the possibilities of collaboration!

Nerdy Joke: Why do developers love git submodules? They can traverse parallel
universes without creating temporal anomalies!
