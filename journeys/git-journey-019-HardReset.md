# Exercise 019 - Hard Reset

Follow the steps in this exercise, and unravel
the enigma of the hard reset. But be warned - with great power comes the
risk of losing your work if used recklessly. Proceed with caution!

Now it's your turn to join the ranks of these
brave time-traveling developers. Are you ready to learn the mysterious art
of the hard reset and wield its power to obliterate undesired changes from
the space-time fabric of your codebase?

Deep within the Git Galaxy, there's a legend
about the hard reset - the ultimate undo button that can erase unwanted
changes from a codebase's timeline. Many developers have embarked on
dangerous journeys to uncover the secrets of this powerful technique.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git reset with the `--hard` option to undo
commits and discard all changes since the specified commit.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Make a few changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

3. Run `git log` to view the commit history.

4. Choose a previous commit hash you want to reset to.

5. Run `git reset --hard <commit_hash>` to reset your branch to the specified commit,
   discarding all changes since that commit.

6. Run `git status` to confirm that your changes have been discarded.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git reset with the `--hard` option to undo
commits and discard all changes since the specified commit. With this skill, you can
erase unwanted changes from your codebase's timeline.

Nerdy Joke: Why do developers love hard reset? It's the ultimate "undo" button when
time-traveling in code!
