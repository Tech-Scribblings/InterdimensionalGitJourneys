# Exercise 001 - Jump to a Parallel Universe

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create a new branch, which represents a parallel
universe in the spacetime continuum of your git repository.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Run `git checkout -b parallel-universe` to create a new branch and switch to it.

   This command creates a new branch called "parallel-universe" and automatically moves
   you to this parallel universe.

3. Make some changes to your `README.md` file, reflecting the alternate reality you
   envision for this parallel universe.

4. Run `git add README.md` to stage the changes.

5. Run `git commit -m "Exploring a parallel universe"` to commit your changes in this
   new universe.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and navigated to a parallel universe.
Now you can explore multiple realities with ease!

Nerdy Joke: How do time travelers keep their code organized? They use Git, because it's
the best way to branch out!
