# Exercise 017 - Soft Reset

Take your first step into this fantastic journey
by following the instructions in this exercise, and unlock the secrets of
time-traveling developers. Good luck, and may the force of Git be with you!

As a new time-traveling developer, you have been
given the task to master this technique. Your mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to learn the art of soft reset and never worry about your
packed luggage while traveling through time.

In a universe where time travelers use Git as their
favorite tool, they've discovered the ultimate way to pack their bags and
undo their past mistakes without losing their luggage - the soft reset.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git reset with the `--soft` option to undo
commits, while keeping the changes staged.

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Make a few changes to your `README.md` file and commit them.

3. Run `git log` to view the commit history.

4. Choose a previous commit hash you want to reset to.

5. Run `git reset --soft <commit_hash>` to reset your branch to the specified commit,
   keeping your changes staged.

6. Run `git status` to confirm that your changes are still staged.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git reset with the `--soft` option to undo
commits, while keeping the changes staged. With this skill, you can carefully
manipulate the space-time fabric of your codebase.

Nerdy Joke: Why do developers love soft reset? It's like having a time machine that
keeps your luggage packed!
