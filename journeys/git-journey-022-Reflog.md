# Exercise 022 - Reflog

Follow the instructions in this exercise and
unlock the power of the Git Reflog. With this skill, you'll always have a
captain's log for your code adventures through space and time. Good luck,
and may your journey be filled with success!

You have been chosen to learn the secrets of
the Git Reflog, and use it to navigate your time-travel adventures with
confidence. Your mission is to master the art of Git Reflog and become an
expert time-traveling developer, always aware of your past actions.

In the mysterious realm of time-traveling
developers, there's a sacred text that records every action they perform
in their repositories - the Git Reflog. This ancient tome allows them to
keep track of their time-travel escapades and never lose their way in the
complex space-time fabric of their codebases.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git reflog to view a log of all the actions
you've performed in your repository. It's like having a personal journal of your
time-travel adventures!

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Perform various git actions such as committing, checking out branches, and resetting.

3. Run `git reflog` to view the log of all the actions you've performed.

```

   -------------------
   main       A---B---C---D
                       \
   new_branch          E---F---G
   -------------------
```

4. Observe the list of actions and their corresponding commit hashes.

5. If you need to restore a specific action or go back to a certain point in time, you
   can use `git reset`, `git checkout`, or `git rebase` with the appropriate commit
   hash from the reflog.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git reflog to view the log of all the
actions you've performed in your repository. With this skill, you'll never lose track
of your time-travel escapades in your codebase!
