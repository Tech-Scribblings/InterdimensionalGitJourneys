# Exercise 028 - Blame

Join the ranks of these code detectives and learn to wield the power of 
git blame. Dive into the mysteries of your code's past and hold the 
responsible parties accountable for their actions!

With git blame, the detectives analyze each line of code, uncovering the 
secrets of the past and revealing the identity of the elusive figure. 
Together, they work to restore balance to the code universe and maintain 
the integrity of their projects.

A mysterious figure is altering the course of code history, leaving a 
trail of perplexing changes in their wake. A team of time-traveling code 
detectives sets out to unravel this enigma and hold the perpetrator 
accountable.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use git blame to see who made changes to a file
and when. It's like being a detective in a time-travel mystery!

1. Make sure you're in your git repository directory.

2. Choose a file you want to investigate, and run `git blame <file>`.

3. Git will display the file contents with information about each line, including the
   commit hash, author, and timestamp.

4. Use the commit hashes from the blame output to further investigate changes using
   `git show <commit_hash>` or `git diff <commit_hash>`.

Congratulations! You have successfully used git blame to see who made changes to a
file and when. With this skill, you can unravel the mysteries of your code's history
and hold the responsible party accountable!

Nerdy Joke: Why do time-traveling developers love git blame? It's like having a
holodeck simulation that reveals the secrets of their code's past!
