# ðŸš€ Interdimensional Git Journeys ðŸŒŒ

## ðŸŽ‰Welcome Gitstronauts!ðŸŽ‰

Hello, fellow Gitstronauts! As you embark on your journey through these
interdimensional Git exercises, you'll be joining a fantastic community of
like-minded space-time travelers, all eager to master the art of Git!

Our mysterious author, the Interdimensional Traveler, has prepared these
exercises just for you. If you have any questions or comments, you can
try to reach out to them at `it42@gitstronauts.tardis`, 
but unfortunatelly it does not work in this dimension,
so first you need to find other parallel universes, where it may work!

So, prepare for liftoff and get ready to become a true Gitstronaut, exploring
the vast universe of Git knowledge! Good luck, and happy travels!

## ðŸš€ Let's start Interdimensional Git Journeys ðŸŒŒ

Welcome, brave traveler! Are you ready to embark on a spectacular journey
through the vast reaches of time and space? Grab your sonic screwdriver,
enter our TARDIS, and let's explore the fascinating world of git, the ultimate
time-space machine!

Git is more than just a decentralized P2P DLT filesystem, it's your personal
time-space machine, ultimate "undo" button, or parallel universes generator!

Using git is like traveling through parallel universes and time machines!
You can leave your portal at any point in time (`git commit`, `git tag`),
and later use your time machine to come back (`git checkout`).
Then, do things differently, branching out
(`git branch` OR `git checkout -b new_parallel_universe`)
and exploring parallel universes!

But wait, there's more! You can compare different points in time or parallel
universes (`git diff`), analyze the steps you made in a given universe
(`git log`), and use your space traveler's scientific equipment to analyze
differences between those points in space and time (`git diff --cumulative`,
`git diff --summary`).

```

Tired of too long `git` magic spells? Make your shortcuts in `.bashrc` with
`alias`! Or just for `git` subcommand in `~/.gitconfig`!

In this repository, you'll find a series of entertaining git exercises filled
with jokes, ASCII art, and pop culture references. Each exercise is designed
to help you master git concepts while having fun.

So, let's contribute to this repo with example exercises or situations if you
come up with any. We can also use it for pushing test branches, practicing
branching from a branch, complex rebasing, and merge conflict scenarios!

Get ready to exercise your git skills and become a true interdimensional
traveler! Allons-y!

## ðŸŒŸSpecial ThanksðŸŒŸ

A heartfelt thank you to the marvelous GPT-4 language model, the dedicated OpenAI
team, and all the computer scientists and humanity who contributed to its
creation, for helping generate the amazing and entertaining materials for this
course!

We also extend our deepest gratitude to all the UNIX gurus, Linux enthusiasts,
and devoted followers of the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. Thanks to
their tireless efforts, we can enjoy working on UNIX and Linux systems with
such fantastic tools like git in the wonderful world of command line.

So, to all the interdimensional time travelers out there, always remember:
wherever you may be in the git multiverse, you stand on the shoulders of the
greatest minds in history! Let's continue exploring, learning, and having fun,
all while keeping the spirit of the KISS principle alive!
